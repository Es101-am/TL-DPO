# TL-DPO

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The approach aligns models with human preferences without the need for a separate reward model, streamlining the fine-tuning process.

ðŸ“˜ Overview
The DPO-TL.ipynb notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:

  1. Loading a pre-trained LLM using Hugging Face Transformers.

  2. Preparing a dataset of prompt-response pairs with preference annotations.

  3. Applying the DPO algorithm to fine-tune the model based on these preferences.

  4. Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned model.

This method is particularly useful for aligning models with specific human feedback, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.
